New files include ImageEnhancementControls.tsx (editing panel with all sliders and tools), useCropSelection.ts (drag-to-crop hook), and imageProcessing.ts (canvas utilities for upscaling, sharpening, noise reduction, brightness/contrast/saturation, rotation, crop). ImageComparison.tsx is updated to integrate all these features. All REQ acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",
