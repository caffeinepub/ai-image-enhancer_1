  "frontend/src/index.css": "Global styles with OKLCH dark charcoal/amber design system, custom utility classes for glow effects, shimmer animations, gradient text, and upload zone states. Imports Inter and Space Grotesk fonts.",
  "frontend/tailwind.config.js": "Extended Tailwind config with custom amber/gold and charcoal color tokens, Space Grotesk/Inter font families, custom border radii, amber glow box shadows, and fade/scale-in animations.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useQueries.ts": "React Query mutation hook for chunked image upload that sends raw file bytes directly to the backend, then converts returned bytes into a blob URL. Fixes the `BlobPart` type error by slicing the underlying `ArrayBuffer` before passing it to the `Blob` constructor, ensuring a concrete `ArrayBuffer` (not `ArrayBufferLike`) is used.",
  "frontend/src/components/ImageUploader.tsx": "Drag-and-drop + click-to-browse upload component with JPEG/PNG type validation only (no size restrictions or size-related UI text), preview thumbnail, error messages, and reset functionality.",
  "frontend/src/components/ImageComparison.tsx": "Updated side-by-side comparison component that upscales the enhanced image 2× via canvas on arrival, renders it to an output canvas with all real-time adjustments applied, overlays a drag-to-crop selection UI when crop mode is active, and integrates the ImageEnhancementControls panel below the comparison grid.",
  "frontend/src/components/HeroBanner.tsx": "Hero banner using the generated background image with gradient overlays, app logo, tagline, and amber-accented typography.",
  "frontend/src/App.tsx": "Main app component with upload/processing/done/error state machine; stores raw file bytes and file type in refs (via `handleImageSelected`) and passes them to the `useProcessImage` mutation, replacing the previous RGBA-pixel-decode approach with direct file byte upload.",
  "frontend/src/utils/imageProcessing.ts": "Canvas-based image processing utility module exporting functions for multi-step upscaling, sharpening (unsharp mask convolution), noise reduction (box blur), brightness, contrast, saturation (via HSL), rotation (free-angle and 90°), crop, and a combined `applyAdjustments` function that chains all operations on a canvas element.",
  "frontend/src/hooks/useCropSelection.ts": "Custom React hook that manages drag-to-select crop rectangle state on a canvas overlay, providing mouse event handlers, display-to-image-pixel coordinate scaling, and activate/confirm/cancel lifecycle methods.",
  "frontend/src/components/ImageEnhancementControls.tsx": "Cohesive editing panel component with labeled sections for Tone (brightness, contrast), Color (saturation), Detail (sharpness, noise reduction), and Transform (free rotation slider, 90° CW/CCW buttons, crop activate/confirm/cancel), plus a Reset button and Download button, all styled with the amber/charcoal PixelBoost theme."
